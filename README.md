GenericLeaderboard
==================

A leaderboard for competitive gaming.


About
=====

A co-worker and I originally made this to keep track of player rankings in Mario Kart 7. However, it has been genericized so it could possibly be applied to another game. In theory, that could be...

- A real time strategy game (Starcraft)
- A trading card game (Magic the Gathering)
- Rock, Paper, Scissors

The leaderboard keeps track of players, teams, maps, rounds, and scores.
